# Management and Conservation Areas of Marine Ecosystems in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean

Oceanic ecosystems, beyond continental or insular shelves, face increasing human exploitation. Identifying key sites with abundant species, threats, and specific oceanographic conditions is essential for sustainable management of oceanic ecosystem services. This project focused on identifying and evaluating priority management and conservation areas for coastal and oceanic ecosystems in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP).

Through a process that included downloading approximately 45,000 spatial layers, performing 20 million statistical analyses, and consulting with more than 145 local, regional, and global experts in over 50 in-person and virtual meetings, this project calculated a relative importance index based on the weighted overlay of spatial layers from five thematic components related to biodiversity, life stages, oceanographic processes, oceanographic changes, and physical habitats. The results of the analysis identified four large priority management units and a set of smaller areas scattered throughout the region. These units are: the northern unit, located in the Gulf of California and its areas of influence toward the Revillagigedo Archipelago and the coasts of Nayarit; the central unit, extending from the Gulf of Tehuantepec toward Costa Rica; the southern unit, located throughout the area of ​​the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor (CMAR); and the southwestern unit, located in the equatorial thermobiological front. Taken together, these units and the identified scattered areas total an area of ​​4.4 million km2, which represents approximately 25% of the total area of ​​the POT.
